The first manned mission to the Moon was Apollo 11, which launched on July 16, 1969.
The crew consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins.
On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin landed the lunar module Eagle in the Sea of Tranquility.
Armstrong was the first person to step onto the lunar surface, famously saying, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
The crew safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969.
